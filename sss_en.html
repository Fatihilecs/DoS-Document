          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
          
          <h3>When will the game be released?</h3>
          <p>The release date is not exactly known, but DOS will first be launched as a beta. The reason for releasing it as a beta is to prove that the project is real and to collect donations to further develop it.</p>
          
          <h3>What features will the beta include?</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the beta is to "prove that the project is being developed" — let's underline that. There will be a major difference between the beta and the full version. The beta will have limited features, though basic gameplay elements will be present.</p>
          
          <h3>What kind of game is Dominion of States?</h3>
          <p>Dominion of States is a strategy game featuring diplomacy, management, economy, and alternate scenarios. It will support modding, allowing players to create their own scenarios (Mod support will not be available in the beta).</p>
          
          <h3>Which platforms will the game be available on?</h3>
          <p>Beta Version: Android, PC</p>
          <p>Full Version: Android, iOS, Mac, PC, "Not sure about Linux" (Our goal is to release the game in an optimized form)</p>
          
          <h3>Will the game be free?</h3>
          <p>Beta Version: Free</p>
          <p>Full Version: Paid</p>
          
          <h3>What are the minimum system requirements?</h3>
          <p>The minimum requirements haven't been finalized yet, but the goal is to ensure playability on both low and high-end devices.</p>
          
          <h3>Will I be able to create mods for Dominion of States?</h3>
          <p>Yes, the game will support modding and players will be able to create and share their own scenarios (Modding on mobile is also planned). Mods will not be available in the beta version.</p>
          
          <h3>Will there be multiplayer in Dominion of States?</h3>
          <p>Not in the beta version. It's planned for the full version.</p>
          
          <h3>How long will the beta phase last?</h3>
          <p>Once the beta version is released, it will not receive updates unless a game-breaking bug is discovered. Focus will shift to developing the full version.</p>
          
          <h3>How can I contribute to the development by donating?</h3>
          <p>Once it's ready.</p>
          
          <h3>Will there be paid DLCs?</h3>
          <p>Definitely not. DLCs in the full version will not be sold for money, and no features will be locked behind a paywall.</p>
          
          <h3>Will there be content updates?</h3>
          <p>No updates for the beta. Yes for the full version — major updates are planned. Here’s a spoiler for a future full version update: Tanks and Navies.</p>
          
          <h3>Will the game have a story?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely not.</p>
          
          <h3>Will there be in-app purchases in the beta version?</h3>
          <p>No. Only donations — entirely up to you.</p>
          
          <h3>Is Dominion of States similar to Age of History 3 and Europa Universalis IV?</h3>
          <p>You could say that, yes.</p>
